# CCSDS Message Abstraction Layer (MAL) Prototype using Http Binding & XML Encoding
* Visit CCSDS at [Homepage](https://public.ccsds.org/default.aspx)
* Visit MAL at [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Abstraction_Layer)
* Visit HTTP Binding & XML Encoding at [specification](https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/524x3b1.pdf)
## About
In order to verify the clarity and validity of the specification documents, two independent prototypes are implemented. 
After both prototypes are completed, they are verified by interoperability tests using a [test bed](https://github.com/esa/CCSDS_MO_TESTBEDS).
Four different types of tests were conducted and passed. 
1. Prototype-A Server to Prototype-B Client
2. Prototype-B Server to Prototype-A Client
3. Prototype-A Server to Prototype-A Client
4. Prototype-B Server to Prototype-B Client
